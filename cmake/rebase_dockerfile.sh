# Point a Dockerfile's one FROM at a pinned base image. Called by build_boot2docker.sh after the patch
# overlay. Upstream boot2docker hard-codes `FROM debian:bullseye-slim`, inside a pinned third-party
# checkout where Renovate can't see it -- so it rotted until bullseye left security support
# (bullseye-security's Release was last signed 2026-08-31; once that expired, apt-get update failed
# the iso build). The base is pinned in components/boot2docker/version (BASE=, Renovate-tracked) and
# substituted here. Anything but exactly one FROM is refused: which stage of a multi-stage Dockerfile
# to rebase is a decision, not a substitution.
